## Meshing

### General
- [ ] Improve workflow for mesh generation
- [x] Add flexibility for multiple radial layers

### Mapping
- [x] Check iglob --> ibool
- [x] Create global coordinate arrays
- [x] Complete set_gll (GLL setup function in element/mesh)
- [x] Valency

### Boundaries
- [x] Determine boundary elements
- [x] Determine boundary faces

### Sources
- [ ] Function to seek element based on cartesian (or other?) coordinates
- [ ] Spatial Gaussian function over an element as source?


### Integration
- [x] 3D GLL weights
- [x] Jacobians
- [ ] Element normals


### Further down the line
- [ ] Doubling layers?
- [ ] Multiple chunks?
